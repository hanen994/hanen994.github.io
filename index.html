            <h2> Let's take a glance at the history of Tunisia </h2>

            <p>The history of Tunisia is a long and intricate story that has unfolded over centuries. Considered a
                Mediterranean country, Tunisia sits at the northern tip of Africa, not far from the islands of both
                Sardinia and Sicily, part of Italy. Its strategic location meant that it was fought over by the great
                ancient Mediterranean powers.
                <br> The city of Carthage, the ruins of which are now on the outskirts of Tunis, was founded by the
                Phoenicians in the 8th century BC. This site is one of the top places to visit in Tunisia for history
                lovers as it offers a taste of what life would have been like back in the early days of Tunisia. The
                Phoenicians were defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, and this area was then governed by the Romans for
                over 500 years.

                The Arabs invaded in the 7th century, bringing Islam with them. It became part of the Ottoman Empire in
                the 16th century, until the French took control in 1881. Tunisia gained its independence in 1956, but
                French is still widely spoken by a lot of the population. That tumultuous history left its mark on the
                country, and some of the best things to see in Tunisia are the ruins and buildings left behind by each
                of these cultures.

                    <h2>Sidi Bousaid </h2>
                    
                    <p>Sidi Bou Said is a town located about twenty kilometers north-east of Tunis. Perched on a
                        cliff
                        overlooking Carthage and the Gulf of Tunis, it is named after a saint, Sidi Bou Saïd El
                        Beji.

                        The international fame of the village was acquired in 1912 thanks to an English baron
                        who built a
                        magnificent palace. Sidi Bou Said became then a place of rest and inspiration to many
                        artists,
                        musicians and writers such as Chateaubriand, Gustave Flaubert, Alphonse de Lamartine,
                        André Gide,
                        Colette, Simone de Beauvoir, etc.

                        Picturesque white and blue village, Sidi Bou Said enchants with the magic of its colors,
                        its streets
                        of bougainvillea and the beauty of its traditional architecture, jealously preserved.

                            preserved
                            Arab-Muslim cities, and has been listed as a Unesco World Heritage since 1979. <br>

                            It was one of the largest and richest cities of the Islamic world. Some 700
                            monuments, including
                            palaces, mosques, mausoleums, madrasas and fountains, testify to this remarkable

                            by a Kasbah, seat of the Government. It is built around the religious center of the
                            Grand Mosque
                            Ezzaitouna, opening onto a large platform for both market place, public meetings and

                            artisans. Around
                            these souks rise private houses with their narrow streets.

                            noise or bad smell are next to the Grand Mosque (Mosque Ezzaitouna) which
                            constitutes the heart
                            of the medina. Covered or uncovered, they offer an infinity of colors, flavors and

                        of the Olive Tree". It is the largest and most venerable sanctuary of Tunis. <br>The

                        to
                        visitors every day except Friday. <br>The tour costs few dinars and only its court is
                        allowed to the

                        open
                        to the public. In Arabic, we call them "Dyar." Once jealously guarded by their rich
                        owner, these
                        beautiful mansions now house associations and public institutions. Dar Hussein, Dar

                        memorials, called türbes or Tourba. And Zaouïa is a building usually placed under the
                        invocation
                        of a holy person who in most of the cases is buried there.

                                <br> But the three Punic wars it waged against Rome (264-146 BC) led to its
                                complete
                                destruction.
                                Rebuilt by the Romans in 44 BC, Carthage once again became the most prosperous
                                city in
                                Africa under Emperor Augustus. Looted by the Vandals in 440, rebuilt by the
                                Byzantines in
                                533, it was finally conquered by the Arabs in 698. Carthage was then dismantled
                                and served
                                as a quarry for construction of Tunis.

                                1979, is drastically protected by a national classification law.

                    <p>Kafteji is a popular dish in Tunisia. It is traditionally served with grilled lamb liver or
                        merguez (lamb sausage) or a fried egg. It is a mixture of potatoes, tomatoes, green peppers,
                        eggs, pumpkins and possibly zucchini, all roughly cut, fried then mixed and cut into small
                        cubes. The mixture is then salted, seasoned with tomato sauce and served with finely chopped
                        parsley and onion. <br>
                        Kafteji is quite versatile as it can be a main or side dish. It also works perfectly inside
                        the sandwich or baguette. Serve it as a dip and scoop it with a piece of bread or crackers.
                        Make Kafteji dish part of lunch, snack, or dinner. Or add it to your get-together servings.

                    <p>Lablebi consists of whole chickpeas cooked in a broth that is poured on top of small pieces
                        of stale bread. The bowl is then garnished with tuna, poached egg, harissa, and red peppers.
                        When you eat it, you need to mix it all together. Then, you can dig in! The dish is healthy
                        because it is balanced; you’ve got a plant protein, a starchy carb, and a healthy fat which
                        is the olive oil. <br>

                        To make it healthier, you can use stale whole wheat bread instead of the traditional white
                        bread. It is said that Lablabi was created during a war in Tunisia in which they needed to
                        feed soldiers and citizens a balanced meal with inexpensive and shelf-stable ingredients.
