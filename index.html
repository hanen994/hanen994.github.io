                <p Tunisian cuisine, the cuisine of Tunisia, consists of the cooking traditions, ingredients, recipes
                and techniques developed in Tunisia since antiquity. It is mainly a blend of Mediterranean and native
                Punics-Berber cuisine. Historically, Tunisian cuisine witnessed influence and exchanges with many cultures and nations like
                Italians, Andalusians, French and Arabs.Like many countries in the Mediterranean basin, the Tunisian cuisine is heavily based on olive oil,spices, tomatoes, seafood and meat. Yet, it has a distinctive spiciness that differs it from
                surroundingcuisines./p>
        
            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>Tunisian cuisine developed from Berbers, ancient Carthage, Rome, the Islamic conquest of the
                Maghreb, and the Ottoman. <br>The cuisine has been strongly influenced by French and Italian
                (especially Sicilian) cooking. <br> During its era of French colonial rule Tunisia marketed its
                difference to metropolitan France meaning it
                played on French perceptions of "difference" (Orientalism) to sell the produce of the colonies to
                France. <br> The majority of restaurants that catered to international visitors did not serve authentic
                colonial cuisine. <br> Exoticness and difference were emphasized instead in souks and eateries. <br>The
                European
                settlers who traveled to and from France shared their food experiences with the metropolitan French, but
                authentic Tunisian cuisine did not become integrated into the popular cuisine coloniale category of
                French cuisine.</p>
            <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <p>Unlike other North African cuisines, Tunisian food is quite spicy. A popular condiment and ingredient
                which is used extensively in Tunisian cooking, harissa, is a mix of ground chili peppers, garlic, and
                caraway[4] or spices commonly sold together as a paste. It is usually the most important ingredient in
                different sauces and gravies. Westernised harissa mostly contains red chilies to replace black cumin,
                which is different from standard cumin. Other common spices include cumin or cumin seeds, garlic,
                caraway seeds, coriander seeds and paprika. A recipe for the sauce includes red chili peppers and
                garlic, flavored with coriander, cumin, olive oil and often tomatoes.[citation needed]

                Like harissa or chili peppers, tomato paste is also an ingredient integral to the cuisine of Tunisia.
                Tuna, eggs, olives and various varieties of pasta, cereals, herbs and spices are also ingredients which
                are prominently used in Tunisian cooking.

                Potatoes were introduced by European settlers in the early 20th century and have become a common
                ingredient in traditional salads, sauces and couscous. By 1990 one of the most common homemade foods
                with potatoes was French fries.

                Tunisian culinary ingredients include the following typical elements:

                </ul>

                Condiments and flavorings: harissa, rose water, orange blossom water, jasmine water and geranium water.
                Eggs.
                Farm animals: lamb, veal, beef, camel and chicken.
                Fish and seafood: tuna, squid (calamari), octopus, anchovies, eel, sardines, mackerel, red snapper, sea
                bream, sea snails and sea bass.
                Fruits: lemon, oranges, figs, dates, olives, apricots, pomegranates and quince.
                Herbs: parsley, coriander, mint, basil, rosemary, oregano, bay leaves and thyme.
                Nuts: hazelnuts, almonds, chestnuts, pine nuts and peanuts.
                Spices: garlic, anise, saffron, cinnamon, caraway, coriander, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, white
                pepper, black pepper, red pepper and cloves.
                Vegetables: onions, bell peppers, carrots, chickpeas, tomatoes, capers, celery, turnips, potatoes, chili
                peppers (Baklouti peppers), cucumbers and eggplants.
                Other popular ingredients: honey.

                Ojja is a dish with a base of eggs, harissa, and tomato paste.
                Tunisians also produce grapes, wheat, barley and orchard fruits. Once fermented they become wines, as in
                Chateau Mornag which is a staple Tunisian wine, beers (Celtia, Berber or the Stella brand—now owned by
                Heineken of the Netherlands), brandy (Boukha—fig liqueur, Thibarine—herbal date liqueur, or other
                liqueurs made from pomegranates, dates, lotos (jujube), carobs or prickly pears and apple ciders.
                Scented waters with dark rose or blossom petals, similar to aguas frescas with flowers, have been called
                "scents from heaven".

                Tabil, pronounced "tebel," is a word in Tunisian Arabic meaning "seasoning" (similar to adobo in
                Spanish) and now refers to a particular Tunisian spice mix, although earlier it only meant ground
                coriander. Paula Wolfert makes the plausible claim that tabil is one of the spice mixes brought to
                Tunisia by Muslims coming from Andalusia in 1492 after the fall of Granada. Today, tabil, closely
                associated with the cooking of Tunisia, features garlic, cayenne pepper, caraway seeds and coriander
                pounded in a mortar, then dried in the sun. It is often used in cooking beef, veal and game. Organs are
                traditionally staples of Tunisian cooking, such as tripe, lamb brains, beef liver and fish heads.

                Due to the long coastline and numerous fishing ports, seafood has a prominent place in Tunisian cuisine.
                Fish can also be grilled, baked, fried, or stuffed and seasoned with cumin (kamoun). Squid, cuttlefish
                and octopus are served in hot crispy batter with slices of lemon, in a cooked salad, or stuffed and
                served with couscous.

                Snails have been eaten in Tunisia since prehistoric times, as excavated mounds of shells, mixed with
                stone tools and artifacts from the Caspian civilization in the region of Gafsa have proven.[8] Today,
                snails are still enjoyed in several regions, such as Hammamet, the central coast (Sahel) and Kairouan,
                but shunned in others..</p>
